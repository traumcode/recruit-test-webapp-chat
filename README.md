# The project:

I was given the task to write a code for a simple chat , no backend needed, where you have the possibility to write a message to a imaginary person or a imaginary group of persons, where every message is responded back with the same message you write. I made the design from scratch by myself using only simple css.

I used only React and some ant design icons.
